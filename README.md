# Constructor Word Guess

## What do we have here?

This is a word guess game, hangman style, that you play in the terminal.

## Installation

Open your terminal and type the following commands:

$ git clone https://github.com/Jenniferbazelak/ConstructorWordGuess.git
$ cd ConstructorWordGuess
$ npm install
$ node index.js
Then you will see the first prompt to begin the game.

## How To Play
The random word you will be guessing will be displayed with " _ "s.
Type a letter to guess.
Your guesses remaining will display (you only get 8 guesses).
If you guess the random word with 8 guesses or less, you win!
If you run out of guesses without guessing the word, you lose!
